## Announcements

Will be using github and this README as a message board. Check periodically for updates.

10/27: Monster Google Doc updated, have a look at what exists thus far. We can add/remove as we please, and they'll be more than enough for what we currently need even if we can't get some more variety from them (Firey/Icy/Poisoin/etc). Implementation should just require tweaks here and there. -Jordan

10/30: I've started working on ideas for themes/traps. It's not yet finished, but you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/document/d/1YX6R140gGa4ri2gixDD0ymiKPiRndbpVi7OnwCmFpCA/edit?usp=sharing). Input is always appreciated. -Jordan

11/9: [Armor/Weapons/Consumables thus far.](https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/document/d/1HD_VH_KtgKsAfmLSafig0YqoChKScHf81xySMMOXCPo/edit?usp=sharing) -Jordan

11/17: [Spell ideas thus far.](https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/document/d/1bz_cdIKKk-3F8eOK8qZhGk6EdoZEmTnargMD2R9S2yc/edit?usp=sharing) -Jordan

## Introduction

A play-clj rogue like.

## Public Demo

There is a .jar file located under the release directory for public testing. To run, you just need java and you run it like
any other .jar file. All known bugs can be found in docs under the problem report.

## Building

All projects can be built using [Nightcode](https://nightcode.info/), or on the command line using [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) with the [lein-droid](https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid) and [lein-fruit](https://github.com/oakes/lein-fruit) plugins.

### Monster Mash

I've gone ahead and started with some rough ideas on some enemy variety. Feel free to [give it a look](https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/document/d/1a0d1LAEwrvvVeBc5wowEZIq3rvJ1BBQsOQWz686ktbs/edit?usp=sharing) and send any criticisms my way. -Jordan
